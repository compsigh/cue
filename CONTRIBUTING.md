# Contributing to Cue

Thanks so much for taking the time to contribute! 🙏 Cue means a lot to us and students within our community, and we're excited to make it even more useful and stable for all student communities as we head towards **`v1`** in Fall.

## Issues

Currently, the [Issues][issues] are open for bugs and feature requests. Before Cue was open-source, we used Notion to track features and their progress. Those can be found on our [Roadmap][roadmap]. We're in the process of migrating these to GitHub. Please note *new* issues (both bugs and feature requests) will be tracked on GitHub from now on.

### Creating a new issue

🐞 **Bugs:** If you spot a bug, before creating an issue, do please give the [Issues][issues] a quick search to see if it has already been reported, and/or the [Roadmap][roadmap] to see if we've already been working on it. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

💡 **Feature requests:** If you have an idea for a new feature, please create an issue with the `feature request 💡` label. We'll add it to the [Roadmap][roadmap] and prioritize it accordingly. Please note we're super zoned in on **`v1`** for Fall, so we may not be able to get to it right away. However, you're more than welcome to contribute it yourself! See below for more details.

### Solving an issue

You can scan through [existing issues][issues] to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. In general, if we ourselves aren't working on an issue, we won't assign it to anyone — if you find an issue that interests you, you're welcome to open a PR for it. See below for more details.

## Pull Requests

We don't have any particular conventions for PRs, but we do have a few guidelines:

- Please make sure your PR is up-to-date with the `main` branch.
- Please make sure your PR is well-documented and easy to understand.
- Please make sure your PR is well-tested and doesn't break any existing functionality. You can use the built-in eslint rules to check for any errors: `yarn run lint`.
- If you're solving an issue, please link it in the PR description.
